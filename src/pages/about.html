      <h3>What should you know about aito when applying</h3>
      <p>
        aito.ai is a product startup, that operates as an independent Futurice subsidiary. We are launching an intelligent database product, which - essentially - provide diverse set of smart functionality like predictions, matchmaking, personalization, smart search and chat-bot like functionality through SQL-like query interface. We seek to transform the way AI technologies are used in the industry and to democratize AI in the digital landscape.
      </p>
      <h4>What is Aito?</h4>
      <p>
        Aito is way to help companies to become more intelligent with relation to their data. We learned through customer projects and listening the markets that companies, no matter small or big, high-tech or traditional, desire to be more intelligent. In essence what they need is an intelligent database which is easy and fast to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aito’s target is to make developer shine in her team by bringing a developer tool, a set of technology and interfaces, which she can use to add intelligence to their digital functions. We are building a product company, not consultancy service company. Our product will be used as a Saas (or PaaS).
      <p>
        We are confident we are doing something truly new, which will shape the future. Whether it shapes a lot or little, we do not know. Whether we fail first time miserably and after a bit rise even stronger and make it even more successful, we do not know. What we know for sure is that we want to build a team which has vision and courage to choose the right things to start with and attitude to get things done.
      </p>
      <h4>How can you tell if Aito is match for you?</h4>
      <p>
        We are doing our first hirings now. That means that we have an idea what we need, but more important is that you are a person who can grow into the team on our journey which is just beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope you are able to proactively steer yourself to the most important topics in your domain area, and sometimes are capable on jumping to backup other team members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formal competencies or achievement lists are not required. The most important thing is that you have desire and passion to learn, and you want to do that with others. We're a startup, so we can't afford to have too many redundancies in our competencies, so you should bring something new to the mix. It also means you strive for getting things done, regardless of whether we're optimizing the DB core, or washing the dishes after some event we're hosting.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Aito”-word translates to authentic and real. That is the style which steers our doing in everything. We are providing real solutions for real problems. You come purely as yourself and throw your personality to build our team even stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        The environment will be challenging with all of it’s surroundings. You need to be person who can tolerate the uncertainty and challenges and confront them on the spot. We promise a ride you will never forget, sometimes fun, sometimes demanding. And we promise there is always a team with you on this ride to support you.
      </p>
      <p>
        To put it short, this recruitment will be very much being part of forming the culture of Aito.
