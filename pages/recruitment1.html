      <h3>Details of the relationship...</h3>
      <p>
        While we have some core technology ready, we have used the system and similar techniques in a customer projects successfully. We are now in the process of building the core product, and opening the business. That means you actually can jump right on the maturing the product, which rubber is hitting the road very soon.

      <p>
        Now, we are looking for a person to join us and help us with this effort. This person should be able to work both on AI technologies, complex software systems and the daily startup routines. More specifically, we are looking for:
          <br>
          - A person with some data science background. You don't need to be a data scientist, but you should be familiar with the domain either through work, studies or hobbies. Still, stronger background with machine learning and statistical methods is a plus.
          <br>  
          - A person, who gets things done programming wise, and who can comprehend, design and develop complex software systems. This basically requires a strong routine in programming, previous work experience and some familiarity with databases, performance optimization, concurrent programming and the different ways for guaranteeing a software system's robustness. We are using Scala as the main programming language for aito core, so being familiar with Scala is a plus.
          <br>
          - A person, who is ready to do the necessary and important things similarly as we - as the start-up founders - are willing to do. We are willing to do public speaking, hard-core AI engineering as well as cleaning places for our event guests, and we seek to recruit someone with the attitude and flexibility for doing the same
