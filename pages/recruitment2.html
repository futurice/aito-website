      <h3>Details of the relationship...</h3>
      <p>
        While we have some core technology ready, we have used the system and similar techniques in a customer projects successfully. We are now in the process of building the core product, and opening the business. That means you will jump right into building and maturing the product. You'll basically get to work where the rubber is hitting the road.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we are looking for a person to join us and help us with this effort. We're mainly looking for someone who will fill in our gap on working with the Frontend. In our case this means that you should have solid experience with running node.js in production, being fluent with CSS, and have some eye for beauty and usability. Or, if you think we're wrong and feel we should build our stack with Elm, Haskell or something even more exotic, then convince us you know what you're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, you should be fluent and productive with the frontend stack (node.js et. al.) have the want and need to get the work done, but as important, make sure we learn from you and your expertise have experience in running some real life production software understand and be able to enforce a top-notch software process and understand the impact of your this work, and your work in particular, on both our direct customers and also the end-usershave the right attitude and aspiration for building _world class software_, if things go as we plan and hope, we're positioning ourselves against some quite hefty giants in the field, and second-grade simply won't cut it hopefully be able to tick some of the boxes in the tech list consisting of AWS, Google Cloud, Scala, DevOps, ElasticSearch/RDBMS, to be able to work on the entire stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're basically looking for a person who is ready to do the necessary and important things, when they come up. Life in a startup means that basically every day brings forth some new surprise and a chance to learn something new.

      </p>
      <h4>What we offer</h4>
      <p>
        - We're basically offering a front row seat in the roller-coaster. Every day is and will be a bit different for a foreseeable future.
        <br>
        - We don't really believe in "crunch-mode", so we strive to work smarter rather than more. A good work-life balance means we can keep running for a long time. This will be necessary, since this is a long-term relationship, not a one-night stand or short fling.
        <br>
        - A chance to bring-your-own-tech. We don't have rules and policies on how things must be done. If it makes sense for us, our customers and the end-users, then we take it. We have the privilege to do things our way. Any way.
        <br>
        - A salary and a meaningful work-life balance. We don't run a sweat shop, and hence we don't expect you to work for free either.
